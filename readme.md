# Golf Scoring

Today I realized I know nothing about golf. I decided to create a function that keeps track of the score based on swing values.

Golf has a par value which estimates how many swings are required to score the hole. That has a point value of zero.

Any swing over earns positive points. Any swing under earns negative points. Ideally, you want to end up with the lowest score possible.
